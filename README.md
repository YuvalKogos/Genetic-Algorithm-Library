# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

Machine Learning models and optimization methods i iplemented from scratch (without numpy) in goal of learning the math and principles behind traditional ML algorithms.

Current models:
 - MLP (Neural Network) : Multi Layer Perceptron model from scratch for classification problems.
 - Genetic Algorithm : Genetic algorithm library for optimization and searching problems.
 
 Examples and Testing:
 - XOR and IRIS dataset for the MLP model at file "NN_testing.py"
 - Sentence searching for the GA library
 - Neuroevolution library (combination of the MLP model and the GA optimization) will be added soon with Flappy Bird game.
 
 *TODO : support multiple hidden layers (currently the MLP model support only 1 input, 1 hidden and 1 output layers)
