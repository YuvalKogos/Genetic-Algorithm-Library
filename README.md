# Machine-Learning-Libraries-from-scratch

*Basic implementations of Machine Learning concepts (models and optimization methods) made from scratch with python.

Current Libraries:
- Neural Network (MLP) library : Basic Neural Network library from scratch (using the MatrixOperation.py file i made for basic Linear Algebra operations).
- Genetic Algorithm library for optimization and search problems. Tested on a goal of searching a specific word in least amount of time.
